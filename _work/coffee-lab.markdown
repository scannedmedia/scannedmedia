Coffee Lab is speculative branding presentation created to represent a trendy coffee shop. In creating the logo, I opted to make it reminiscent of the periodic table of elements to reinforce the scientific aspect of the word lab. In doing so the rest of the branding elements have a scientific theme.

The color palette was decided upon for its simplicity and direct impact along with a sense of craft. Much like a lab these colors are no-nonsense and have a purpose for each use.
