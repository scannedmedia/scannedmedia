Coffee Lab is speculative branding presentation created to represent a trendy coffee shop. In creating the logo, we opted to make it reminiscent of the periodic table of elements to reinforce the scientific aspect of the word lab. In doing so the rest of the branding elements have a scientific theme.

The color palette was decided upon for its simplicity and direct impact along with a sense of craft. Much like a lab these colors are no-nonsense and have a purpose for each use.
