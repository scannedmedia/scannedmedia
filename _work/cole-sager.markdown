Cole Sager is a personal trainer specializing in cross-fit, ranked 5th nationally in cross-fit competition. Consulting with him personally, we explored how to represent his branding. He wanted something simple, clean-cut, trustworthy, powerful, passionate and stated “something powerful yet graceful”. In the early stages of our process, we felt an eagle represented those qualities well and showed him some thumbnails he loved. The color palette was chosen to exemplify these characteristics with orange being powerful and passionate, and blue counter-acting to create balance with grace. Finally, for the type, we took his signature and transcribed it in a hand-lettered style.
