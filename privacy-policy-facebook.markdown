  your location (such as a cell ID), browser type, browser language, connection history, and the date and time of
  your request.</p>
<p>Cookies: We may use a technology called “cookies”. A cookie is a tiny element of data that websites can send to
  your browser, which may then be stored on your device so we can recognize you when you return. We use cookies to
  improve the quality of our Service, including for storing user preferences, improving ad selection, and tracking
  user trends. You may set your Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to not accept certain cookies.
  However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, you may not be able to take advantage of all of the features
  of our Services.</p>
<p>Advertising: We and other third parties (such as ad networks, data exchanges, and other service providers) may
  also use cookies and similar technologies to provide you with advertisements and promotions when you use our
  Services. The information collected by these third parties may be used to tailor ads you see both on our Services
  and on third-party websites. You can choose not to receive tailored advertising from listed ad networks, data
  exchanges, and other service providers using this online tool. You can opt out of Google’s specific use of cookies
  for these purposes by visiting Google’s Ads Preferences Manager. If you opt out of receiving tailored advertising

  intended as an endorsement of or referral to the linked websites. The linked websites have separate and independent
  privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully. We do not have any control
  over such websites, and therefore we have no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the organizations
  that operate such linked websites may collect, use or disclose, secure and otherwise treat your personal
  information.</p>
<p>We may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use
  this information to improve the quality of our content and services.</p>

  unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure of personal information in our custody and control.
  Unfortunately, no collection or transmission of information over the Internet or other publicly accessible
  communications networks can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and therefore, we cannot ensure or warrant the
  security of any such information.</p>
<p>Data Integrity</p>
<p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current,
  but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.</p>
<p>Accessing and Updating Personal Information</p>
<p>You have the right to access, update, and correct inaccuracies in your personal information in our custody and
  control, subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law. You may request access, updating and corrections of
